Summary of the data science projects that we have been working on.

# [Project 1 : CLASSIFICATION OF CELL PHONES ACCORDING TO PRICE](https://github.com/AlexanderPereda/Alexander-Pereda-Projects/blob/main/Cell%20phone%20price%20ranking%20with%20SVM.ipynb)

* A multiple classification algorithm was created to rank the different cell phone prices in 4 categories.
* EDA was performed on the dataset looking for which variables have the greatest impact on the classification.
* We train a basic model and then optimize it step by step to see how the right choice of parameters can influence the final algorithm.
* We use EDA, GridSearchCV and  Support Vector Classifier to obtain the best model.
