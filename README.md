Summary of the data science projects that we have been working on.

## [Project 1 : CLASSIFICATION OF CELL PHONES ACCORDING TO PRICE](https://github.com/AlexanderPereda/Alexander-Pereda-Projects/blob/main/Cell%20phone%20price%20ranking%20with%20SVM.ipynb)

* A multiple classification algorithm was created to rank the different cell phone prices in 4 categories.
* EDA was performed on the dataset looking for which variables have the greatest impact on the classification.
* We train a basic model and then optimize it step by step to see how the right choice of parameters can influence the final algorithm.
* We use EDA, GridSearchCV and  Support Vector Classifier to obtain the best model.

## [Project 2 : DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION USING PCA](https://github.com/AlexanderPereda/Alexander-Pereda-Projects/blob/main/Dimensionality%20reduction%20using%20PCA.ipynb)

* The number of variables was reduced from 12 to 8 while retaining more than 80% of the information.
* We studied the correlation of the variables in the dataset.
* We fill in the missing data using a simple imputer with the median method.

## [Project 3 : PROBABILITY OF SUFFERING A STROKE USING RANDOM FOREST](https://github.com/AlexanderPereda/Alexander-Pereda-Projects/blob/main/Probability%20of%20suffering%20a%20stroke%20using%20Random%20Forest.ipynb)

* An algorithm was developed that can predict the likelihood of a stroke.
* We explore the data looking for relationships between variables, while transforming them for later use.
* To enrich the dataset, we perform feature engineering (polynomical features).
* Data balancing (undersampling) was applied.
* We instantiate the model and then optimize it.
* Finally, we sort the results into a DataFrame so that it can be exported and used.
